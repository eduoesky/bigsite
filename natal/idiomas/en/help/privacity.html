            This is a informative page about the privacity. <br> Here you will see some necessary theme/questions about the data storage. <br><br>
            <strong>1. How are the stored data stored?</strong>
            <br>The data stored in the emails is used solely for me to be in contact with you. The website www.oesky.com was created solely for the purpose of interaction between me and my audience (you). <br>
            The data <strong class="importante">WILL NO STAY</strong> stored in the history of this site, referencing the email or Pou's nickname." <br>
            About the likes system (if you no accessed, access <a href="../secundarios/info-like.html">here</a>), If you use the same email more than 3 times in the service, it won't work for this specific service anymore. In other words, the email (or other data) is not stored on the site, but by using it more than 3 times, the email used will be available for any other service except for the Likes service. <br><br>
            <strong>2. How is used the data?</strong> <br>
            The data is used in the following way:: <br>
            <strong>To like</strong>: The email is sent to the form verification system, where it is analyzed for the server. The Pou's name is sent to the form verification system, where it is analyzed for the server and then sent directly to the Pou's server to perform the action of giving a like to the user's Pou name that you entered and submitted. During the process, the form server checks if the email actually exists (anti-fraud system); if it's determined to be a fake email that doesn't exist, the like is automatically denied. However, the system temporarily stores your email for tracking 3 attempts. If it exceeds this limit, the system will no longer work with the same provided data. <br>
            <strong>To visits</strong>: The email in those systems is optional and only is used to confirm if the visit that you asked was done, btw, is no used to nothing more. The Pou nickname is send to the check form system, so it is checked and there is sent to the Pou server directly to realize the action of to visit (and send the respective messages, if you choose)  <br>
            <strong>To messages</strong>: So, the email, even though it is mandatory, is used only for that I can send a reply message. Btw, the no frauds server do the forms denied.
            <strong>To the check folder</strong>:The email, even though it's mandatory, is only used for you to send me a message in response. Once again, the anti-fraud server prevents non-existing emails from being sent to the form. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES will the email provided by the requester be used to inform the Pou account owner to verify the report, thus maintaining anonymity. <br><br>
            <strong>3. The used email had risk of happens an invasion or hacked?</strong>
            <br>It is very likely that it will not. The emails used are sent in the form through the method <i>POST</i>, which greatly complicates unauthorized access. Furthermore, I strongly recommend using an email that is not the Pou email, in other words, a personal or contact email.
