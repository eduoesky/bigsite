We are leaving this message because at (March 8, 2024), OesKy suffered a traffic accident and is currently in a coma, according to his family. We will keep this site closed until she fully recovers. We know that clarifying the horrifying reason in this way is not the best solution, but this had already been disclosed previously. Thanks to those who read this and sorry for the inconvenience. Remember: life first! We offer solidarity to those who are concerned and for any other reasons, as the situation is not at all simple. Rooting for recovery is the first thing we should do. <b>#BeStrong</b><br><br>Att: Pou</p>
